        <p class="lead" id="parag">Fairouz's crystalline voice – her stage name means "turquoise" in Arabic – and her haunting lyrics about love, life, Lebanon and Jerusalem, have made her an icon second only to the legendary Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, mourned by millions when she died. Like her, Fairouz, who is Lebanese by origin and is now 83, is loved and feted as a national treasure across the Arabic-speaking world – and known and admired far beyond it.</p>
